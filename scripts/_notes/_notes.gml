"Failure Meeter"
This is how I could have the Cthulu stuff start out.
There is a "fear of failure". As customers orders are failed then it starts
to increase and the higher it gets then weird stuff happens.
Til the point the character "breaks" This could be the game over.
And there should be ways to reduce this? Maybe a "perfect" day
and things to buy to help with the sanity
